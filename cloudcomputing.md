## Types of Cloud Computing
  
### Public Cloud 
Public cloud computing is a type of computing in which a service provider makes resources available to the public via the internet. Resources vary by provider but may include storage capabilities, applications or virtual machines. Public cloud services may be free or offered on a pay-per-usage model.  

- Azure 
- AWS
- Google Cloud
- IBM Cloud
- Oracle Cloud
- Alibaba Cloud
- ...


### Private Cloud 

Private cloud is a type of cloud computing that delivers similar advantages to public cloud, including scalability and self-service, but through a proprietary architecture. Unlike public clouds, which deliver services to multiple organizations, a private cloud is dedicated to a single organization.  

Examples:
- OpenStack
- ...


### Hybrid Cloud  

Hybrid cloud is a type of cloud computing that combines on-premises infrastructure—or a private cloud—with a public cloud. Hybrid clouds allow data and applications to be shared between them.  

Examples:
- Azure Stack
- AWS Outposts
- Google Anthos
- ...  

## IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)  

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS is one of the three main categories of cloud computing services, alongside Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS).   


Virtualization is a key component of IaaS. The IaaS provider manages the virtualization layer, while users manage operating systems, applications and data.   

Virtual Machines (VMs) are a common example of IaaS. VMs are created from a pool of shared physical hardware resources, such as servers, storage and networking.
